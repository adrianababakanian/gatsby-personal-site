is the world's largest secondary ticketing marketplace &mdash; but most people only visit the site to buy a ticket that they already know they want. Experiences that enables event discovery are lacking in the industry. Since event-going is often an end-to-end experience that entails more than just the event itself, I and a small team of interns in design, user research, product management, and SEO took on the task of creating a single page for event and venue discovery richly enhanced by external data and filtering functionalities.

Our team framed our design, research, and development around the following question: How might we enable users to discover inspiring event experiences in a particular city?
