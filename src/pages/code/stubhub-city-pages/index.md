is the world's largest secondary ticketing marketplace &mdash; but most people only visit the site to buy a ticket they already know they want. Experiences that enable event discovery are lacking in the industry. Since event-going is often an end-to-end experience that entails more than just the event itself, I and a small team of interns in design, user research, product management, and SEO took on the task of creating a single page for event and venue discovery richly enhanced by external data and filtering functionalities.

Our team framed our design, research, and development around the following question: How might we enable users to discover inspiring event experiences in a particular city?

## Technologies

I implemented the city page in React. I also made extensive use of external APIs, primarily

<a href="https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro" target="_blank" class="matcha">Google Places</a>.

## User Research
Several rounds of user testing were performed throughout the summer, including guerilla testing, formalized research in a usability lab, targeted testing, and more.

## Takeaways
This project gave me the opportunity to develop a complex application within a large, existing codebase revolving around a very modern web development framework. I was entrusted with a lot of responsibility as the sole developer on the project.
