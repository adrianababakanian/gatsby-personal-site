title: "Cal Hacks Branding"
---

[Cal Hacks](https://calhacks.io) is a nonprofit organization composed of students passionate about fostering a culture of hacking, entrepreneurship, and social good via the empowerment of technology. Our claim to fame is throwing the world’s largest collegiate hackathon every fall! I’ve been a director at Cal Hacks since January of 2017. As our team’s designer, Cal Hacks is for me the perfect vessel to utilize my love of design as a tool for progressing the causes that inspire me.

I recently took on the immense role of creating a permanent brand for Cal Hacks, an organization whose visual identity was previously defined by an iterating annual design corresponding to each iteration of our hackathon. As we’ve matured from a startup-like environment into an established organization, our influence in the realm of technology extends beyond the space of hackathons into entrepreneurship, diversity, inclusivity, and beyond — thus rendering a cohesive branding identity crucial!

Check out my process behind establishing our visual identity below. You can also take a look at the work I did for Cal Hacks 4.0, before the permanent brand was initialized!
