As both an engineer and designer, prototyping for me is one of the most rewarding forms of art. In spring 2017, I took a course at Berkeley's [Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation](http://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/our-space/) on prototyping and fabrication. My final project entailed designing, engineering, building, and programing a Bluetooth-controlled robot vehicle from scratch with the ultimate goal of navigating hands-free through a msystery obstacle course. I named the robot Mo &mdash; he's an agile tread chassis-based robot with some snazzy direction-based colored pixel animations!


## Technologies
I worked with the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3) microcontrollers, [Adafruit Bluefruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2479) modules, [neopixels](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1463), and other electronics to motorize and control a chassis-based robot from sratch constructed from scratch using 3D modeling, laser cutting, and other prototyping equipment.

Since I created Mo completely from scratch, I designed, engineered, and printed all non-electronic parts of Mo in [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview?mktvar002=724861&mkwid=sOICwxb1H|pcrid|226118724187|pkw|autodesk%20fusion%20360|pmt|e|pdv|c|slid||pgrid|52893102612|ptaid|kwd-488376946792|&intent=&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=GGL_FUSION360_US_BR_SEM_EXACT%3EBrand&utm_term=autodesk%20fusion%20360&utm_content=sOICwxb1H|pcrid|226118724187|pkw|autodesk%20fusion%20360|pmt|e|pdv|c|slid||pgrid|52893102612|ptaid|kwd-488376946792|&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIi-bkpeu02AIVFNVkCh3JOA2pEAAYASAAEgK8bfD_BwE&dclid=CN7KiajrtNgCFUv0ZAodRJMORg) &mdash; a 3D CAD program that allows for designing, engineering, and simulating.
