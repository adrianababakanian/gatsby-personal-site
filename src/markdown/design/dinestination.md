CS 160 is UC Berkeley’s course in User Interface Design & Development. I took the course in Spring 2018 — and as an acutely visual person with a passion for interaction-driven engineering, loved the experience. The class was divided into teams which each developed an Android application from the ground up, starting with brainstorming and then moving through the iterative design process of sketching, prototyping, UER development, user testing, and production. I enjoyed CS 160 so much that I am now a GSI on the course staff for Fall 2018!

My team developed an Android app called Dinestination, an application that determines the best place for a user to eat based on time constraints and target destination. Feel free to check out our source code and final project video!

Many thanks to my team members Irene Li, Daryus Medora, Michael Ferrin, & Michael Zhao for our very successful project and for being a power team!
