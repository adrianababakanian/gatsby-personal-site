Throughout 2017, I created the branding for [Cal Hacks 4.0](https://calhacks.io) under the general guidance of a California road trip theme to celebrate the fact that advanced and beginner hackers alike come to California from all over the world to hack with us in Berkeley.

Every iteration of Cal Hacks gets dressed in a new bear named dd0ski, representing UC Berkeley's mascot Oski. I designed the Cal Hacks 4.0 dd0ski as the central component of our hackathon's visual identity â€” this little guy was featured on thousands of shirts, swag bags, badges, wristbands, and more.
