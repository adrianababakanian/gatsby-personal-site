I'm a director at Cal Hacks, the largest hackathon in the world! One of my main roles is as graphic designer â€” logos, branding, marketing, you name it. Throughout 2017, I created the branding for Cal Hacks 4.0 under the general guidance of a California road trip theme to celebrate the fact that advanced and beginner hackers alike come to California from all over the world to hack with us in Berkeley.
