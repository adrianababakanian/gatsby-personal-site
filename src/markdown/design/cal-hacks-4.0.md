Cal Hacks 4.0 was the fourth iteraion of Cal Hacks, the world's largest collegiate hackathon. Throughout 2017, I created the branding for [Cal Hacks 4.0](https://calhacks.io) under the general guidance of a California road trip theme, in celebration of the fact that advanced and beginner hackers alike come to California from all over the world to hack with us in Berkeley.

Every iteration of Cal Hacks gets dressed in a new bear named dd0ski. dd0ski is aptly named &mdash; a [DDoS](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-ddos-attack/) is a type of hack (a Distributed Denial of Service attack, to be precise) and [Oski](https://calspirit.berkeley.edu/oski/history.php) is UC Berkeley's mascot.  I designed the Cal Hacks 4.0 dd0ski as the central component of our hackathon's visual identity â€” this little guy was featured on thousands of shirts, swag bags, badges, wristbands, and more.
